# Git homework - User manual
It is a group development of a brief description of the key Git commands.


Requirements:
  * the study should be in the form of a single-file HTML page
  * all commands from the following list must be described (what they do and what they can be useful for + examples of use)
  * the whole thing should be correct in terms of language

Way of work:
  * Each student creates his own copy of the repository (fork)
  * Make changes there (preferably in the branch per feature model)
  * Then sends a Pull Request to the original repository
 
The task will be completed by those who together:
  * will make a substantial substantive contribution to the development (adding a command description, modifying the existing script, code review)
  * create their own repository (fork)
  * send Pull Request to the original repository
 
List of commands to describe:
 

 * git config --global user.name ""
 * git reset HEAD
 * gitk -all
 * git branch --merged
 * git branch "branch" "commit hash"
 * git pull "remote" "branch"
 * git config --global user.email ""
